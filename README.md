# James's attempt at making a chess engine in Go 

I am pausing on the go-chess tui because of ui frustrations so for the love of chess, i want to look at how people have made chess engines and try to make my own 

1. this is a different look at chess rather than building a wrapper around chess
2. it will help me appreciate how computer chess programs function a lot better!

steps:
- [ ] board representation 
- [ ] search/evaluation 
- [ ] UCI + time management
